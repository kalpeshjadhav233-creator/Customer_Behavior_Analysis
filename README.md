# Data Analytics Project – Analysis & Visualization

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data loading to final business insights. The process includes data exploration and cleaning using Python, querying structured data using MySQL, and building an interactive dashboard in Power BI to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## Dataset

* Source: CSV file (can be replaced with any structured dataset)
* Type: Structured transactional / business data
* Contents: Contains multiple attributes used for analysis such as categories, dates, numerical measures, and identifiers
* Size: Medium-scale dataset suitable for analytics and visualization

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn) – Data loading, EDA, and cleaning
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis environment
* **MySQL** – Data storage and SQL querying
* **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation
* **Git & GitHub** – Version control and project sharing

---

## Project Steps

1. Loaded the raw dataset into Python using Pandas
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns and distributions
3. Cleaned the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types
4. Transferred the cleaned data to a MySQL database
5. Wrote SQL queries to extract insights and answer business questions
6. Connected MySQL data to Power BI
7. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard
8. Created a final analytical report summarizing key insights

---

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

* Key performance metrics and KPIs
* Trend analysis using charts and visuals
* Category-wise and time-based insights
* Interactive filters for dynamic analysis
